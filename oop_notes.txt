everything in python is a class instance

for instance run type(cat) or type(5) and see thattheir both actually instances of the string and int classes
the legal functions we can string off these are referred to as methods just like in ruby
we can create our own class very easily by running class Dog: def bark(self): print("Im a Dog... Bark.")

now we can create a new instance by running d1=Dog()
and we can run our method just as you would expect with d1.bark()
